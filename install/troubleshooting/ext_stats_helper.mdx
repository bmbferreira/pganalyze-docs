import { MonitoringUserExtStats } from "../../components/MonitoringUserSetupInstructions";

You may see the following warning in the pganalyze app:

```
Your database appears to be missing extended stats monitoring helper functions,
so the data of extended statistics are not available. Please review the relevant
troubleshooting documentation.
```

This warning indicates that extended statistics for the specific database are
not being reported by the collector. Extended statistics are used by pganalyze
to improve Index Advisor recommendations. Index Advisor will still work without
the helper functions, but index recommendations may be less accurate.

To resolve this, first, make sure you are running at least collector version
0.53.0 (and ideally the latest version). You can see which version you are
currently running by checking the Debug Info panel on the Server Settings tab of
the Settings page for your server. Then, find the name for the database role
that's configured as the monitoring user in your collector installation (we'll
assume "pganalyze" here).

<MonitoringUserExtStats username="pganalyze" />

Note that unlike other pganalyze helper functions, this function must be
installed in *every database* that you intend to monitor separately.

After creating the helper function in all monitored databases, re-run the
collector test to confirm the warning is no longer displayed.
