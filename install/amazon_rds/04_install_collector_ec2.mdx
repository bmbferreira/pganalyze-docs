## Installing the collector on an Amazon EC2 Instance

For this step, you first need to choose whether you want to install the collector on an existing EC2 instance, or run a new one.

The [pganalyze collector](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector) is a daemon process that continuously collects database statistics, and submits them to the pganalyze dashboard in recurring intervals.

You can either run it on a small instance, or add it to an existing EC2 instance in your environment.

When monitoring a single medium-sized database `t3.micro` is usually large enough, though you may need `t3.small` to monitor multiple large databases.

## Starting a new EC2 instance

Start a new Amazon Linux 2 based instance that has the IAM role applied:

<p>
  <ImgRdsNewInstanceRole />
</p>

Then follow the step to install the collector on Amazon Linux 2 based instances.


## Installing the collector on the instance

<CollectorInstallInstructions apiKey={props.apiKey} />

After successful installation the pganalyze collector will now be running in the background on your server.
